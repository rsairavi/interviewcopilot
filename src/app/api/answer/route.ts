      return `Here's how I'd answer "${question}" using STAR format as a ${roleLabel}:

Situation: On a recent project, our team faced a critical challenge around ${focus} that required quick, high-stakes decision-making.

Task: I was responsible for defining the technical approach, coordinating across teams, and ensuring we delivered without compromising quality or reliability.

Action: I started by scoping the problem precisely — identifying what we knew vs. didn't know. I proposed a phased rollout: first a minimal proof-of-concept to de-risk the approach, then incremental delivery with automated validation at each step. I communicated trade-offs clearly to stakeholders and kept the team focused on the highest-impact work.

Result: We delivered ahead of the adjusted timeline, with measurable improvements in the key metrics we targeted. The approach became a template the team reused for similar challenges.

For the live interview, I'd tailor this with the specific numbers and project name from my experience.`;

    case "system_design":
      return `For "${question}", here's my design approach as a ${roleLabel}:

Requirements first: I'd clarify expected scale (requests/sec, data volume), latency SLAs, consistency requirements, and budget constraints around ${focus}.

High-level architecture: I'd sketch the main components — API gateway, application layer, data stores, caching layer, and async processing pipeline. Each component choice is driven by the specific requirements.

Key design decisions for ${focus}:
• Storage: Choose between relational (PostgreSQL) for strong consistency or NoSQL (DynamoDB/Cassandra) for horizontal scale, based on access patterns.
• Caching: Redis for hot-path data, CDN for static assets. Cache invalidation strategy matters as much as the cache itself.
• Async processing: Message queue (Kafka/SQS) for workloads that don't need synchronous response.

Scaling considerations: Horizontal scaling of stateless services, read replicas for the database, sharding strategy if data exceeds single-node capacity.

Trade-offs I'd call out: CAP theorem implications, cost of over-engineering vs. shipping and iterating, and operational complexity of each added component.`;

    case "comparison":
      return `For "${question}" — let me break down the key differences around ${focus}:

Core distinction: These concepts serve different purposes and excel in different scenarios. The right choice depends on your specific constraints.

Comparison along key dimensions:
• Performance: Each has distinct performance characteristics depending on workload type (read-heavy vs. write-heavy, latency-sensitive vs. throughput-optimized).
• Use case fit: One tends to be better for ${keywords[0] || "simpler scenarios"} while the other shines in ${keywords[1] || "complex, distributed systems"}.
• Complexity: There's usually an inverse relationship between flexibility and operational overhead.
• Ecosystem: Community support, tooling maturity, and hiring availability differ significantly.

When to use which: For most teams, I recommend starting with the simpler option and migrating when you hit concrete scaling limits — premature optimization here is costly. In interviews, I'd give a specific example from a project where I made this exact trade-off decision.`;

    case "coding":
      return `For "${question}", here's my approach as a ${roleLabel}:

Algorithm insight: The key to solving this efficiently around ${focus} is recognizing the underlying pattern — whether it's a sliding window, two-pointer, graph traversal, or dynamic programming problem.

Approach:
1. Start with the brute-force solution to establish correctness.
2. Identify the bottleneck — usually redundant computation or unnecessary traversals.
3. Apply the right data structure (hash map for O(1) lookup, heap for top-k, trie for prefix matching) to eliminate that bottleneck.

Complexity: I'd aim for the optimal time complexity and call out the space trade-off explicitly.

Edge cases to handle: empty input, single element, duplicates, integer overflow, and negative values.

In a live interview, I'd write clean, well-named code with brief comments on the non-obvious parts, and walk through a test case verbally.`;

    case "concept":
      return `${keywords[0] ? keywords[0].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + keywords[0].slice(1) : "This concept"} is a fundamental topic in ${roleLabel} work. Let me explain ${focus} clearly:

Definition: At its core, this is about ${focus} — the mechanism that enables specific behavior in production systems.

Why it matters: Without understanding this properly, you risk building systems that seem correct in development but fail under real-world conditions (scale, concurrency, edge cases).

Concrete example: In a production system I worked on, ${keywords[0] || "this concept"} was critical for ensuring reliability. When we didn't account for it properly, we saw intermittent failures that were hard to reproduce. The fix involved understanding the underlying mechanics, not just the API surface.

Common misconception: Many engineers confuse the theoretical definition with practical implementation. In production, the nuances around ${keywords.slice(1).join(", ") || "edge cases and failure modes"} matter much more than textbook descriptions.

In practice, this means: always test under realistic conditions, understand the failure modes, and have observability in place to catch issues early.`;

    default:
      return `For "${question}", here's my perspective as a ${roleLabel}:

Direct answer: The approach I'd take for ${focus} depends on the specific constraints, but here's my default starting point based on production experience.

From my experience: I've worked with ${focus} in production systems where the key challenge wasn't getting a working solution, but building one that's maintainable, observable, and performs well under real load. The decision usually comes down to 2-3 viable approaches with different trade-off profiles.

What I'd emphasize in an interview:
• Start with the simplest approach that meets requirements — don't over-engineer.
• Call out specific trade-offs: performance vs. maintainability, consistency vs. availability, build vs. buy.
• Show awareness of operational concerns: monitoring, alerting, rollback strategy.
• Reference a concrete example where I made a similar decision and what I learned.

The goal is to demonstrate that I think beyond just "does it work?" to "how does it behave in production at scale?"`;
